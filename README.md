## Cryptography Lessons

This repo contains my scratch work implementations of cryptographic functions as detailed in "Fundamentals
of Cryptography: Introducing Mathematical and Algorithmic Foundations" by Duncan Buell (isbn 9783030734916).
These implementations aren't meant to be production-grade, they're simply for my own edification.
